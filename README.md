## Installation

### Bioconda

You can install `nf-core/tools` from [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/nf-core/README.html).

First, install conda and configure the channels to use bioconda
(see the [bioconda documentation](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html)).
Then, just run the conda installation command:

```bash
conda install nf-core
```

Alternatively, you can create a new environment with both nf-core/tools and nextflow:

```bash
conda create --name nf-core python=3.7 nf-core nextflow
conda activate nf-core
```

### Python Package Index

`nf-core/tools` can also be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nf-core/) using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install nf-core
```

### Development version

If you would like the latest development version of tools, the command is:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/nf-core/tools.git@dev
```

If you intend to make edits to the code, first make a fork of the repository and then clone it locally.
Go to the cloned directory and either install with pip:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or install directly using Python:

```bash
python setup.py develop
```

## Listing pipelines

The command `nf-core list` shows all available nf-core pipelines along with their latest version,  when that was published and how recently the pipeline code was pulled to your local system (if at all).

An example of the output from the command is as follows:

```console
$ nf-core list

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

```

To narrow down the list, supply one or more additional keywords to filter the pipelines based on matches in titles, descriptions and topics:

```console
$ nf-core list rna rna-seq

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

nf-core/lncpipe    dev        -             -               -
nf-core/smrnaseq   dev        -             -               -
```

You can sort the results by latest release (`-s release`, default),
when you last pulled a local copy (`-s pulled`),
alphabetically (`-s name`),
or number of GitHub stars (`-s stars`).

```console
$ nf-core list -s stars

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\

```

Finally, to return machine-readable JSON output, use the `--json` flag.

## Launch a pipeline

Some nextflow pipelines have a considerable number of command line flags that can be used.
To help with this, the `nf-core launch` command uses an interactive command-line wizard tool to prompt you for
values for running nextflow and the pipeline parameters.

If the pipeline in question has a `parameters.settings.json` file following the [nf-core parameter JSON schema](https://nf-co.re/parameter-schema), parameters will be grouped and have associated description text and variable typing.

Nextflow `params` variables are saved in to a JSON file called `nfx-params.json` and used by nextflow with the `-params-file` flag.
This makes it easier to reuse these in the future.

It is not essential to run the pipeline - the wizard will ask you if you want to launch the command at the end.
If not, you finish with the `params` JSON file and a nextflow command that you can copy and paste.

```console
$ nf-core launch rnaseq

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

## Downloading pipelines for offline use

Sometimes you may need to run an nf-core pipeline on a server or HPC system that has no internet connection. In this case you will need to fetch the pipeline files first, then manually transfer them to your system.

To make this process easier and ensure accurate retrieval of correctly versioned code and software containers, we have written a download helper tool. Simply specify the name of the nf-core pipeline and it will be downloaded to your current working directory.

By default, the pipeline will download the pipeline code and the [institutional nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs) files.
If you specify the flag `--singularity`, it will also download any singularity image files that are required.

Use `-r`/`--release` to download a specific release of the pipeline. If not specified, the tool will automatically fetch the latest release.

```console
$ nf-core download methylseq -r 1.4 --singularity

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'


INFO: Saving methylseq

INFO: MD5 checksum for nf-core-methylseq-1.4.tar.gz: f5c2b035619967bb227230bc3ec986c5
```

The tool automatically compresses all of the resulting file in to a `.tar.gz` archive.
You can choose other formats (`.tar.bz2`, `zip`) or to not compress (`none`) with the `-c`/`--compress` flag.
The console output provides the command you need to extract the files.

Once uncompressed, you will see the following file structure for the downloaded pipeline:

```console
$ tree -L 2 nf-core-methylseq-1.4/

nf-core-methylseq-1.4

    └── README.md

10 directories, 15 files
```

The pipeline files are automatically updated so that the local copy of institutional configs are available when running the pipeline.
So using `-profile <NAME>` should work if available within [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs).

You can run the pipeline by simply providing the directory path for the `workflow` folder.
Note that if using Singularity, you will also need to provide the path to the Singularity image.
For example:

```bash
nextflow run /path/to/nf-core-methylseq-1.4/workflow/ \
     -profile singularity \
     -with-singularity /path/to/nf-core-methylseq-1.4/singularity-images/nf-core-methylseq-1.4.simg \
     # .. other normal pipeline parameters from here on..
     --reads '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome GRCh38
```

## Pipeline software licences

Sometimes it's useful to see the software licences of the tools used in a pipeline. You can use the `licences` subcommand to fetch and print the software licence from each conda / PyPI package used in an nf-core pipeline.

```console
$ nf-core licences rnaseq

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'


INFO: Warning: This tool only prints licence information for the software tools packaged using conda.
        The pipeline may use other software and dependencies not described here.

## Creating a new workflow

The `create` subcommand makes a new workflow using the nf-core base template.
With a given pipeline name, description and author, it makes a starter pipeline which follows nf-core best practices.

After creating the files, the command initialises the folder as a git repository and makes an initial commit. This first "vanilla" commit which is identical to the output from the templating tool is important, as it allows us to keep your pipeline in sync with the base template in the future.
See the [nf-core syncing docs](https://nf-co.re/developers/sync) for more information.

```console
$ nf-core create

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

INFO: Done. Remember to add a remote and push to GitHub:
  cd /path/to/nf-core-nextbigthing
  git remote add origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
  git push --all origin

INFO: This will also push your newly created dev branch and the TEMPLATE branch for syncing.

INFO: !!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!

If you are interested in adding your pipeline to the nf-core community,
PLEASE COME AND TALK TO US IN THE NF-CORE SLACK BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE!

Please read: https://nf-co.re/developers/adding_pipelines#join-the-community
```

Once you have run the command, create a new empty repository on GitHub under your username (not the `nf-core` organisation, yet) and push the commits from your computer using the example commands in the above log.
You can then continue to edit, commit and push normally as you build your pipeline.

Please see the [nf-core documentation](https://nf-co.re/developers/adding_pipelines) for a full walkthrough of how to create a new nf-core workflow.

Note that if the required arguments for `nf-core create` are not given, it will interactively prompt for them. If you prefer, you can supply them as command line arguments. See `nf-core create --help` for more information.

## Linting a workflow

The `lint` subcommand checks a given pipeline for all nf-core community guidelines.
This is the same test that is used on the automated continuous integration tests.

For example, the current version looks something like this:

```console
$ cd path/to/my_pipeline
$ nf-core lint .

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

## Working with pipeline schema

nf-core pipelines have a `nextflow_schema.json` file in their root which describes the different parameters used by the workflow.
These files allow automated validation of inputs when running the pipeline, are used to generate command line help and can be used to build interfaces to launch pipelines.
Pipeline schema files are built according to the [JSONSchema specification](https://json-schema.org/) (Draft 7).

To help developers working with pipeline schema, nf-core tools has three `schema` sub-commands:

* `nf-core schema validate`
* `nf-core schema build`
* `nf-core schema lint`

### nf-core schema validate

Nextflow can take input parameters in a JSON or YAML file when running a pipeline using the `-params-file` option.
This command validates such a file against the pipeline schema.

Usage is `nextflow schema validate <pipeline> --params <parameter file>`, eg:

```console
$ nf-core schema validate my_pipeline --params my_inputs.json

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'


INFO: [✓] Pipeline schema looks valid

ERROR: [✗] Input parameters are invalid: 'reads' is a required property
```

The `pipeline` option can be a directory containing a pipeline, a path to a schema file or the name of an nf-core pipeline (which will be downloaded using `nextflow pull`).

### nf-core schema build

Manually building JSONSchema documents is not trivial and can be very error prone.
Instead, the `nf-core schema build` command collects your pipeline parameters and gives interactive prompts about any missing or unexpected params.
If no existing schema is found it will create one for you.

Once built, the tool can send the schema to the nf-core website so that you can use a graphical interface to organise and fill in the schema.
The tool checks the status of your schema on the website and once complete, saves your changes locally.

Usage is `nextflow schema build <pipeline_directory>`, eg:

```console
$ nf-core schema build nf-core-testpipeline

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

There are three flags that you can use with this command:

* `--no-prompts`: Make changes without prompting for confirmation each time. Does not launch web tool.
* `--web-only`: Skips comparison of the schema against the pipeline parameters and only launches the web tool.
* `--url <web_address>`: Supply a custom URL for the online tool. Useful when testing locally.

### nf-core schema lint

The pipeline schema is linted as part of the main `nf-core lint` command,
however sometimes it can be useful to quickly check the syntax of the JSONSchema without running a full lint run.

Usage is `nextflow schema lint <schema>`, eg:

```console
$ nf-core schema lint nextflow_schema.json

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'


ERROR: [✗] JSON Schema does not follow nf-core specs:
 Schema should have 'properties' section
```

## Bumping a pipeline version number

When releasing a new version of a nf-core pipeline, version numbers have to be updated in several different places. The helper command `nf-core bump-version` automates this for you to avoid manual errors (and frustration!).

The command uses results from the linting process, so will only work with workflows that pass these tests.

Usage is `nf-core bump-version <pipeline_dir> <new_version>`, eg:

```console
$ cd path/to/my_pipeline
$ nf-core bump-version . 1.0

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

 + RUN conda env export --name nf-core-mypipeline-1.0 > nf-core-mypipeline-1.0.yml
```

To change the required version of Nextflow instead of the pipeline version number, use the flag `--nextflow`.

To export the lint results to a JSON file, use `--json [filename]`. For markdown, use `--markdown [filename]`.

As linting tests can give a pass state for CI but with warnings that need some effort to track down, the linting
code attempts to post a comment to the GitHub pull-request with a summary of results if possible.
It does this when the environment variables `GITHUB_COMMENTS_URL` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are set and if there are
any failing or warning tests. If a pull-request is updated with new commits, the original comment will be
updated with the latest results instead of posting lots of new comments for each `git push`.

A typical GitHub Actions step with the required environment variables may look like this (will only work on pull-request events):

```yaml
- name: Run nf-core lint
  env:
    GITHUB_COMMENTS_URL: ${{ github.event.pull_request.comments_url }}
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    GITHUB_PR_COMMIT: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
  run: nf-core lint $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
```

## Sync a pipeline with the template

Over time, the main nf-core pipeline template is updated. To keep all nf-core pipelines up to date,
we synchronise these updates automatically when new versions of nf-core/tools are released.
This is done by maintaining a special `TEMPLATE` branch, containing a vanilla copy of the nf-core template
with only the variables used when it first ran (name, description etc.). This branch is updated and a
pull-request can be made with just the updates from the main template code.

This command takes a pipeline directory and attempts to run this synchronisation.
Usage is `nf-core sync <pipeline_dir>`, eg:

```console
$ nf-core sync my_pipeline/

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'


INFO: Pipeline directory: /path/to/my_pipeline

INFO: Fetching workflow config variables

INFO: Deleting all files in TEMPLATE branch

INFO: Making a new template pipeline using pipeline variables

INFO: Committed changes to TEMPLATE branch

INFO: Now try to merge the updates in to your pipeline:
  cd /path/to/my_pipeline
  git merge TEMPLATE
```

If your pipeline repository does not already have a `TEMPLATE` branch, you can instruct
the command to try to create one by giving the `--make-template-branch` flag.
If it has to, the sync tool will then create an orphan branch - see the
[nf-core website sync documentation](https://nf-co.re/developers/sync) for details on
how to handle this.

By default, the tool will collect workflow variables from the current branch in your
pipeline directory. You can supply the `--from-branch` flag to specific a different branch.

Finally, if you give the `--pull-request` flag, the command will push any changes to the remote
and attempt to create a pull request using the GitHub API. The GitHub username and repository
name will be fetched from the remote url (see `git remote -v | grep origin`), or can be supplied
with `--username` and `--repository`.

To create the pull request, a personal access token is required for API authentication.
These can be created at [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
Supply this using the `--auth-token` flag.

Finally, if `--all` is supplied, then the command attempts to pull and synchronise all nf-core workflows.
This is used by the nf-core/tools release automation to synchronise all nf-core pipelines
with the newest version of the template. It requires authentication as either the nf-core-bot account
or as an nf-core administrator.

```console
$ nf-core sync --all

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'
